## Known Issues

- Some dog breed images may load slowly on slower internet connections due to reliance on external API resources.
- Currently, the app supports login for existing Fetch Rewards accounts only; user registration and password reset flows are not implemented.
- Favorites are stored locally in the browser and do not persist across devices or sessions.
- Accessibility improvements, such as enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support, are planned but not yet fully implemented.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement user registration and password recovery functionality to support a wider user base.
- Add advanced breed filters (e.g., size, temperament, energy level) to improve user search experience.
- Integrate backend persistence for user favorites and settings to allow cross-device access.
- Enhance accessibility compliance to meet WCAG guidelines, improving usability for all users.
- Add automated testing to improve code quality and reliability.
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading techniques and caching strategies.
